# Streaming-Wars

This was a project long due. This is a Data Analysis project where I worked on various online streaming platforms to understand where and why they stand in the market today. This project contains a detailed analysis of Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, Paramount+, and AppleTV+. Furthermore, the project uses HuggingFace's Roberta Model to understand the reviewer's sentments whether it is positive, negative or neutral. 

Hope you enjoy the project!
